## Introduction

Academy Xi not only teaches the up and coming Data scientists it also supports and mentors some of Australia's best musicians under it's second company Xi Records.
Xi Records have tasked me to find if it is possible to predict if a song with certain characteristics would be popular ie. succesful.
To do this I have found some data from one of the top Music software used today. Spotify of course.

## The Data

The Dataset is entitled "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023" it has 943 rows with 24 columns. In spotify terms the no. of streams indicates the number of plays ie. how popular a particular is and therefore how succesful it is. This is the independent variable we will be predicting.
